# A Star Algorithm

This is a pathfinding algorithm in C++ which works on nodes that checks from the start node to the neighbours nodes until it arrives at the end node. I have created a visualization using Raylib to demonstrate the algorithm. In the images below you will be able to see the starting point and ending point. As also, the line in yellow demonstrates the patht that the algorithm has chosen as the shortest. Also I have implemented a obtacle you for fun and to show that even with a wall the algorithm will be able to find the path.
